# Building a Custom Rowing App
Goals: 
1. Enable GPS tracking of outdoor workout & export map to Apple Fitness & Strava
2. Use IMU data to detect strokes
3. Track metrics for: distance, stroke rate, & current 500m pace
4. Ability to turn on water lock
5. Display rings + heart rate zones
6. Publish metrics to fitness app

# Getting Started:
I am starting with the following sample code from a WWDC21 session: [10009: Build a workout app for Apple Watch](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10009/).
